# Face Mask Detection Using CNN

This project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which has been directly imported into Google Colab for training and testing the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It consists of a collection of images with two classes: "with_mask" and "without_mask". The images in the "with_mask" class depict individuals wearing face masks, while the images in the "without_mask" class depict individuals without face masks.

To use this dataset, follow these steps:

Download the dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset).
Upload the dataset to your Google Drive or directly to Google Colab.
Update the file paths in the code to point to the correct location of the dataset in your environment.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

Python (3.x recommended)
TensorFlow (2.x recommended)
Keras (2.x recommended)
NumPy
Matplotlib
Kaggle API

## Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files:

Copy_of_DL_Project_5_face_Mask_Detection_using_CNN.ipynb: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code for training and testing the face mask detection model.
dataset/: This directory contains the link to the dataset obtained from Kaggle.
readme.md: This file contains information about the project, instructions, and guidelines.

## Usage
Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
Copy_of_DL_Project_5_face_Mask_Detection_using_CNN.ipynb file to your Google Colab environment.
Upload the dataset obtained from Kaggle to the dataset/ directory in Google Colab or to your Google Drive.
Open the Copy_of_DL_Project_5_face_Mask_Detection_using_CNN.ipynb file in Google Colab.
Update the file paths in the code to point to the correct location of the dataset.
Run the code cells in the notebook to train and test the face mask detection model.
The trained model will be saved in the models/ directory.
## Results
After running the code, the model will be trained on the provided dataset. The training progress and evaluation metrics will be displayed in the output cells of the notebook. Once training is complete, the model will be saved in the models/ directory.

You can use the saved model for face mask detection on new images or in real-time video streams. The model can classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not.
